# Data-Visualisation


**Data Visualization**

Data visualization is the practice of translating data into visual contexts, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to understand and to draw comprehension from. 

The main goal of data viewing is to make it easier to identify patterns, styles, and vendors in large data sets. 

The term is often used in a unique way, including information drawings, information visuals, and mathematical diagrams.

Data visualization can be important for strategic communication: it helps us interpret available data; identify patterns, tendencies, and inconsistencies; make decisions, and analyze existing processes. 

All told, it could have a profound effect on the business world. 


**Data Visualization Process**

Several different fields are involved in the data recognition process, to facilitate or reveal existing relationships or discovering something new in a dataset.

**1. Filtering and processing.**

Refining and refining data transforms it into information by analyzing, interpreting, summarizing, comparing, and researching.

**2. Translation & visual representation.**

Creating visual representation by describing image sources, language, context, and word of introduction, all for the recipient.

**3. Visualization and interpretation.**

Finally, visual acuity is effective if it has a cognitive impact on knowledge construction.
